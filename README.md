# CAPSTONE PROJECT: Predicting CMS Cincinnati physician reimbursement payments for 2020 (during COVID) based on historical payment information  

### Problem Statement:
Is it possible to predict CMS payments for 2020 made to physicians in Cincinnati Ohio for the top 10 most reimbursed drugs or biologics based on historical CMS payments from 2013 through 2019?

Using the 2013-2020 General Payments data files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (ttps://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Data/Dataset-Downloads), is it possible to use time series forecasting to predict 2020 CMS Cincinnati physician payments for these ten historically most reimbursed drugs/biologics:  Xarelto, Victoza, Humira, Levemir, Invokana, Entresto, Farxiga, Chantix, Myrbetriq and Toujeo?

Stakeholders for this analysis include drug manufacturers and CMS patients who are interested in the future trends of medicines that they are producing/using.

### Executive Summary:
